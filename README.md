## Description

## Task 1: API Integration and Data Visualization using Python

This project is part of the **CodeTech Python Programming Internship**. The objective of Task 1 is to demonstrate how Python can be used to fetch data from a public API and visualize it in a meaningful way.

In this task, real-time weather forecast data is retrieved from the **OpenWeatherMap API** using Python. The API response is received in JSON format and processed to extract temperature and date-time information. The extracted data is then visualized using a line graph to show temperature variations over a period of time.

The project focuses on understanding the basics of API integration, handling JSON data, and using Python libraries for data visualization. The `requests` library is used to send HTTP requests to the API, and `matplotlib` is used to create the graphical representation of the data.

This task helped in gaining practical experience with external APIs, working with real-world data, and converting raw data into visual insights using Python.

### Technologies Used

* Python
* OpenWeatherMap API
* Requests
* Matplotlib

### Output

* A Python script that fetches weather data from an API
* A line graph displaying temperature trends for the selected location

### Learning Outcomes

* API integration using Python
* JSON data processing
* Data visualization
* Practical application of Python libraries
